# **Image Steganography with AES Encryption 🔐**  

## **📌 Overview**  
With the rise of cybersecurity threats, protecting sensitive information has become crucial. This project implements **image steganography with AES encryption** to securely hide messages within images. Unlike traditional encryption methods that may attract suspicion, this method provides a **covert** and **efficient** way to communicate securely.  

## **🚀 Features**  
✔️ **AES Encryption** – Securely encrypts messages before embedding them in an image.  
✔️ **Image Steganography** – Hides messages within image pixels, making it undetectable.  
✔️ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple and intuitive GUI for easy encryption and decryption.  
✔️ **Password-Protected** – Decryption requires a passcode for added security.  
✔️ **Message Integrity** – Ensures the hidden data remains unaltered.  

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter  
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, PIL (Pillow)  
- **Cryptography**: PyCryptodome (AES Encryption)  

## **📦 Installation**  
### **1️⃣ Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have Python installed. If not, download it from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/).  

### **2️⃣ Install Required Libraries**  
Run the following command to install the dependencies:  
```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow pycryptodome
```

## **💻 Usage**  
1️⃣ **Run the Application:**  
```bash
python steganography.py
```
2️⃣ **Encrypt a Message:**  
- Enter the secret message.  
- Set a password for security.  
- Click "Encrypt" to hide the message within an image.  

3️⃣ **Decrypt a Message:**  
- Load the encrypted image.  
- Enter the correct password.  
- Click "Decrypt" to reveal the hidden message.
